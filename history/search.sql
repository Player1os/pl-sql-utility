-- Assuming we have a generic table and have already created a historified table for it as described in the `definition.sql` script
-- and that the &datestamp parameter contains the datestamp we wish to view:

SELECT /*+ PARALLEL USE_HASH */
	"h".*,
	"h".rowid
FROM
	"table_history" "h"
WHERE
	&datestamp
		BETWEEN "h"."start_datestamp"
		AND "h"."end_datestamp"
