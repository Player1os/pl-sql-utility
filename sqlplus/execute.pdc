-- SQL*PLUS

-- The first line of this file is required due to SQLPLUS not supporting UTF8 with BOM and the PLSQL Developer requiring UTF8 with BOM to allow for external editing without corrupting Unicode characters.

-- Choose one of the following:
-- 1. Write the content of the script to be executed followed by a 'COMMIT;' statement if required.
-- 2. Import scripts using the '@relative_filepath.sql' statement.

-- Due to the 'AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8' value of the NLS_LANG environment variable, it is possible to freely use any Unicode characters in this script as well as any imported script.
