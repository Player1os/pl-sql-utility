-- The first line of this file is required due to SQL*PLUS not supporting UTF8 with BOM and the PL/SQL Developer requiring UTF8 with BOM to allow for external editing without corrupting Unicode characters.

-- Choose one of the following:
-- 1. Write the content of the script to be executed followed by a "COMMIT;" statement if required.
-- 2. Import scripts using the "@'relative_file_path.sql';" statement.

-- It is recommended to output a description of the scripts to be executed using a PROMPT statement for clarification.

-- Due to the 'AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8' value of the NLS_LANG environment variable, it is possible to freely use any Unicode characters in this script as well as any imported script.
