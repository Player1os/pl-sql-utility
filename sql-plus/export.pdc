-- Beware of the following restrictions when writing the following SELECT queries:
-- 1. It is recommended to convert any numeric values to strings beforehand, due to the effects of the NUMWIDTH parameter.
-- 2. The max width for the outputted column is 32000 characters by default.

-- Export each column separately to ensure correct formatting, set the column's alias to 'output'.

-- Each outputted line (including the last one) is ended by the CR and LF characters.
